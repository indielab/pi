	// Address is the human-readable bound address after startup. It is empty
	// before Start, after Close, and for transports that have no address.
	//
	// DIVERGENCE (deliberate): pi types this `string | undefined` and the server
	// filters the undefined ones out of its address list. Go has no undefined
	// string, so the empty string carries that meaning and is filtered the same
	// way — an address that is genuinely "" would not be printable anyway.

	// Start binds the transport and calls accept for each connection. It must
	// not return until the transport is bound or has failed.
	Start(ctx context.Context, accept Acceptor) error
	// Close unbinds the transport and releases its resources. Repeated calls
	// must be harmless.
	Close(ctx context.Context) error
