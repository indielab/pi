// Package server is the Go port of pi's transport-neutral session server
// (@earendil-works/pi-server): it serves the protocol package's wire format to
// pi clients over any ordered byte transport.
//
// The core in this package owns the handshake, the connection lifecycle, and
// session ownership. It knows nothing about sockets — a transport supplies
// connections through a Listener. The Unix-domain transport lives in
// server/unix.
//
// DIVERGENCE (deliberate): pi's legacy/ tree (process supervision, CLI, OAuth)
// is not ported. It is Node process machinery rather than protocol behaviour,
// and the owner ruled it out of scope (docs/UPSTREAM.md, 2026-08-01).
