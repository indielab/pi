// Every count is in UTF-16 code units: scan, the probe length and the result,

// counts. The search itself runs on bytes — a match of a whole-rune head is a
// match in either unit, and candidates come in the same order — so only the
// tail's start, the head's end and the result are translated. A cut that lands
// inside a surrogate pair is where the two units disagree: pi's head then ends
// with a lone high surrogate and pi's tail may open with a lone low one. The
// head keeps the whole runes before the cut and remembers the rune the cut
// split, so a candidate must also continue with the same high surrogate; the
