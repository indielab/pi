// EventStream is a generic, thread-safe async event queue with a deferred final
// result. It is the Go port of pi's EventStream<T, R> (event-stream.ts).
//
// Producers call Push for each event and (optionally) End to terminate. A single
// "complete" event — identified by isComplete — captures the final result via
// extractResult and unblocks Result. Consumers range over Events (an iterator)
// or pull events with Next, and may await the final result with Result.
//
// Like pi, the stream holds TWO collections: buffered events with no consumer
// yet (queue), and consumers waiting with no event yet (waiting). Push hands an
// event DIRECTLY to the longest-waiting consumer, bypassing the queue, so
// events reach blocked consumers in registration order — pi's `waiting` FIFO
// (upstream b2602be77), pinned here by
// TestEventStreamDeliversToWaitersInRegistrationOrder. pi's two-stack FifoQueue
// itself has no Go counterpart: it exists to make JS's O(n) Array.shift() an
// O(1) dequeue, and a Go slice reslice is already O(1).
