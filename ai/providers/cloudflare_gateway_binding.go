// AI Gateway transport over the Workers AI binding (pi 230029078,
// packages/ai/src/api/cloudflare-gateway-binding.ts).
//
// pi's Cloudflare AI Gateway support speaks HTTPS
// (`gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account}/{gateway}/{provider}/...`, see
// cloudflare.go), which needs a Cloudflare API token even when the caller is a
// Worker in the gateway's own account.
//
// NewGatewayBindingDoer returns an [ai.HTTPDoer] that translates requests under
// a gateway HTTPS prefix into calls to the Workers AI binding's universal
// endpoint, `env.AI.gateway(id).run({provider, endpoint, headers, query})`.
// Binding calls are pre-authenticated in-account and return the provider's
// native wire format as a regular (streaming) response, so API implementations
// behave identically over either transport.
//
// The result is the transport for one gateway-bound client, not a
// general-purpose doer: requests it cannot serve — URLs outside the prefix, or
// in-prefix requests the universal endpoint cannot express (non-POST, non-JSON
// body) — fail with a descriptive error. Transport selection is the caller's
// job, per client: route such traffic over HTTPS with real gateway auth
// instead of through this shim.
//
// This surface is LATENT in the Go port: an [AIGatewayBinding] can only come
// from a Cloudflare Workers runtime, which Go does not target, so nothing in
// the port supplies one today. It is ported because it is public SDK surface
// under pi-ai's "./api/*" subpath export — the same reason StreamOptions.Env
// and ProviderRequestOptions.TelemetryContext are ported latent. See the
// 2026-08-11 ruling in docs/UPSTREAM.md.
//
// pi's fetch-input polymorphism has no counterpart here. Its
// createGatewayBindingFetch must reconcile two overlapping sources of truth
// (a Request input and a RequestInit override) across six body types and four
// header shapes, with fetch-spec rules for `body: null` and `signal: null`.
// An *http.Request has already normalized all of that, so the port keeps the
// observable behavior and drops the reconciliation.
//
// What does NOT come for free is pi's URL layer: `new URL()` applies WHATWG
// normalization that neither url.Parse nor path.Clean reproduces. Empty path
// segments survive, a trailing "."/".." leaves a trailing slash, the host is
// lowercased and a default port is dropped. resolveGatewayPath and
// normalizedGatewayOrigin below exist to match it; path.Clean is wrong here
// because it collapses "//" (which would change how provider/endpoint splits)
// and drops the trailing slash (which decides which rejection fires).
