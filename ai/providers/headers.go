// Header plumbing for ai.ProviderHeaders, whose nil values are deletion markers
// (see ai.ProviderHeaders). pi applies those markers two different ways, and
// the difference is observable, so the port keeps both:
//
//   - Adapters that hand the merged headers to a vendor SDK as `defaultHeaders`
//     (openai-completions, openai-responses, anthropic-messages) let the SDK
//     delete on null, which also removes a header the SDK itself would have
//     sent, its auth header included. sdkHeaders is that path: the SDK's own
//     bundles around pi's object, which headerObject.applyAsDefaultHeaders
//     writes.
//   - Adapters that build the request themselves (google-generative-ai,
//     pi-messages) run the merged headers through providerHeadersToRecord
//     (pi utils/headers.ts), which folds names case-insensitively: the last
//     slot for a name wins, and a null there deletes every earlier spelling
//     of it from the record (upstream a328aa89a). The record is then spread
//     over the adapter's own literal headers, so a null still cannot remove a
//     header the adapter set literally. headerObject.applyAsRecord (google)
//     and applyAsFetchInit (pi-messages) are that path.
//
// Both paths end in a fetch Headers object in pi — the SDK's, or the one fetch
// builds from pi-messages' plain object — and Headers.append/set normalize
// every value by stripping its leading and trailing HTTP whitespace. net/http
// does not: it fails the request on a CR or LF anywhere in a value, and its
// HTTP/2 encoder sends a value's edges verbatim. So every value is normalized
// here as it is written (setHeader), which makes a key or token read with a
// trailing newline work as it does in pi instead of failing the stream.
//
// Before it normalizes anything, a Headers object converts each name and value
// it is given to a WebIDL ByteString (see byteString): a character above U+00FF
// fails the request before it is sent, and U+0080..U+00FF go out as one Latin-1
// byte each, where net/http would send the UTF-8 bytes of any string. After it
// normalizes a value, it refuses a name that is not an HTTP token and a value
// holding a NUL, CR or LF, with a TypeError of its own (see checkHeaderToken,
// normalizeHeaderValue), where net/http fails the round trip with its text and
// the retry loop tries it again. Every name and value is converted and checked
// here, in the order pi's Headers sees them, so the same input fails with the
// same message, at once, or is sent as the same bytes.
//
// Two divergences live in here and are recorded in docs/UPSTREAM.md rather than
// papered over: an empty or whitespace-only User-Agent value is dropped
// entirely where pi sends the header present-and-empty (setHeader normalizes a
// whitespace-only value to empty, and net/http omits an empty User-Agent), and
// @google/genai comma-joins a record entry onto its own User-Agent or
// x-goog-api-client default when the entry spells the name differently, where
// this package — which sends neither default — sends the record's value alone.

// headerObject models the ONE header object pi builds per provider request.
//
// It is an ordered map because pi's is one. A JS object keeps its string keys
// in insertion order, and assigning to a key it already holds updates that key
// IN PLACE instead of moving it to the end — so a later source that re-spells a
// name an earlier source already inserted does NOT get promoted past the names
// inserted in between. Two names differing only by case are two distinct keys
// there but one header on the wire, and both the vendor SDKs and net/http
// resolve that collision by taking the LAST of them; which one is last is
// exactly the slot information an http.Header cannot hold.
//
// Folding every source into this before touching the request is what keeps the
// two agreeing. Concretely, on the anthropic OAuth branch pi's object holds
// "User-Agent" (the seeded pi default) at slot 0 and "user-agent"
// (claude-cli/<v>) at a later slot, so a caller spelling the name "User-Agent"
// lands back in slot 0 and loses to the Claude Code identity — while a caller
// spelling it "user-agent" or "USER-AGENT" wins. Writing straight to an
// http.Header made the later WRITE win regardless of spelling, which is not
// what pi does.
